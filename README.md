## WEB-203 Machine Problem: To-Do List

As a user

- I want to be able to create to-do items so that I can list the tasks I have to do
- I want to be able to mark a to-do as done/pending so that I'll know which tasks are done/pending
- I want to be able to remove a to-do item so that I can remove tasks that I no longer need to see
- I want to be able to show/hide done to-do items so that I can decide whether to view only pending tasks, or all tasks
- I want to be able to add sub tasks to a to-do so that I can break down a task into smaller tasks
